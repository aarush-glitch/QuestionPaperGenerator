      "question": "(a) Briefly outline a general approach to minimizing the total travel cost for all SIM card distribution scenarios within a weighted graph, considering the core logic of the algorithm.\n\nA general approach involves a greedy algorithm. Start by assigning the minimum cost edge to each pair of vertices. Then iteratively refine the assignments by minimizing the total cost of the remaining edges, ensuring that each edge's cost is always less than or equal to the cost of the previous assignment. This continues until all edges have been assigned.\n\n(b) Describe the role of the cost parameter w within the graph G(V,E,w), explaining why it-s crucial to consider it when determining the minimum.\n\nThe cost parameter 'w' represents the overall cost of a particular path through the graph.  It is crucial to consider 'w' because it quantifies the \"distance\" or \"cost\" of traversing the graph.  A higher 'w' value signifies a more costly path; therefore, the algorithm should prioritize paths with the lowest total cost, minimizing the overall travel expense.  Without considering 'w', the algorithm might choose paths that are significantly longer, ultimately increasing the overall travel cost.",
