CSRF introduction CSREF is an attack which forces an end user to execute unwanted actions on a web application in which user is currently authenticated. With a little help of social engineering (like sending a link via email or chat), an attacker may force the users of a web application to execute actions of the attackers choosing. A successful CSRF exploit can compromise end user data and operation, when it targets a normal user. lf the targeted end user is the administrator account, a CSRF attack can compromise the entire web application. The objective of this attack is to 1) transfer the money from one bank to another, 2) use a content management system to add/delete content from a website, 3) change passwords, 4) manipulate user/customer information, etc. 21

How CS RF works For a CSRF attack to be possible, three key conditions must be in place: 1. A relevant action. There is an action within https://vulnerable-website.com/email/changeemail=pwnedevil-user.net the application that the attacker has a reason to induce. This might be a privileged action (such as modifying permissions for other users) or any action on user-specific data (such as changing the users own password). 2. Cookie-based session handling. Performing the action involves issuing one or more HTTP requests, and the application relies solely on session cookies to identify the user who has made the requests. There is no other mechanism in place for tracking sessions or validating user requests. ie 11 [)) 3. No unpredictable request parameters. The requests that perform the action do not contain any parameters whose values the attacker cannot determine or guess. For example, when causing a user to change their password, the function is not vulnerable if an attacker needs to know the value of the existing password. 22 Ref: https://portswigger.net/web-security/csrf

Practicing CSRF Configure the Burpsuite in the Kali Linux, to do this, visit https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/getting-started/proxy-setup/browser Qpen a browser in Kali Linux and visit the site https://portswigger.net/web-security/csrf and go through the methods and examples of CSRF CSRF vulnerability with no defenses: https://portswigger.net/web-security/csrf/lab-no-defenses (check the solution to experiment) Click on Access Lab, user name and password are wiener:peter Go to exploit server and follow the given solution in the above link. Other CSRF attacks (practice by referring above link) O OO0000 CSRF where token validation depends on request method CSRF where token validation depends on token being present CSRF where token is not tied to user session CSRF where token is tied to non-session cookie CSRF where token is duplicated in cookie CSRF where Referer validation depends on header being present CSRF with broken Referer validation 23

Preventing CSRF attacks The most robust way to defend against CSRF attacks is to include a CSRF token within relevant requests. The token should be: o Unpredictable with high entropy, as for session tokens in general. o Tied to the users session. o Strictly validated in every case before the relevant action is executed.

How XSS works Cross-site scripting works by manipulating a vulnerable web site so that it returns malicious JavaScript to users. When the malicious code executes inside a victims browser, the attacker can fully compromise _ their interaction with the application. There are three main types of XSS attacks. These are: o Reflected XSS, where the malicious script comes from the current HTTP request. o Stored XSS, where the malicious script comes from the websites database. o DOM-based XSS, where the vulnerability exists in client-side code rather than server-side code.

Preventing XSS Filter input on arrival. At the point where user input is received, filter as strictly as possible based on what is expected or valid input. Encode data on output. At the point where user-controllable data is output in HTTP responses, encode the output to prevent it from being interpreted as active content. Depending on the output context, this might require applying combinations of HTML, URL, JavaScript, and CSS encoding. Use appropriate response headers. To prevent XSS in HTTP responses that arent intended to contain any HTML or JavaScript, you can use the Content-Type and X- Content-Type-Options headers to ensure that browsers interpret the responses in the way you intend. Content Security Policy. As a last line of defense, you can use Content Security Policy (CSP) to reduce the severity of any XSS vulnerabilities that still occur. https://portswigger.net/web-security/csrf 28 as
