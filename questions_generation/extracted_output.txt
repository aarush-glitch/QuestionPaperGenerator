Question Paper Generated for JIIT Q1. (3 marks) [Time: 14 min] A telecom company wants to distribute SIM cards to different cities of a state. Since the cities are connected directly/indirectly, for the SIM card distribution the company first decided to compute the minimum cost of travelling between all cities using a weighted graph G(V,E,w). Where V represents the city number, E represents the edges (connections) between different cities and w is the cost of travelling from one city to another. Determine the shortest path distance between every pair of vertices in the weighted graph G(V,E,w). Write the function to compute the final cost of each vertex pair. [7] Provide a function that implements Dijkstra-s algorithm to calculate the shortest path distances between all pairs of cities in the graph G(V, E, w), and return the final cost matrix. Justify your approach by highlighting the core steps and how they address the problems requirements. Topic: Graphs Subtopic: Graphs Marks: 3 Time: 14 Q2. (3 marks) [Time: 11 min] Analyze the relationship between a node:s parentage and its direct and indirect descendants. Specifically, identify the parent-child relationships for node 9, node 2, and node 5, and then explain how the parent-child structure determines the number of direct and indirect descendants of node 9. Provide a detailed example illustrating the process, including the number of direct and indirect descendants you identify. Topic: Algorithms Subtopic: Parent-Child Relationships Marks: 3 Time: 11 Q3. (5 marks) [Time: 20 min] A telecom company wants to distribute SIM cards to different cities of a state. Since the cities are connected directly/indirectly, for the SIM card distribution the company first decided to compute the minimum cost of traveling between all cities using a weighted graph G(V,E,w). Where V represents the city number, E represents the edges (connections) between different cities and w is the cost of travelling from one city to another. Your task is to determine the shortest path for each vertex pair in the weighted graph G(V,E,w). Write the function to compute the final cost of each vertex pair. [7] (a) Briefly outline a general approach to minimizing the total travel cost for all SIM card distribution scenarios within a weighted graph, considering the core logic of the algorithm. (b) Describe the role of the cost parameter w within the graph G(V,E,w), explaining why it-s crucial to consider it when determining the minimum cost. (c) Assuming the graph G(V,E,w) has a total of 10 cities (V=1 to 10), provide a concise, step-by-step implementation of your function in pseudocode or Python. Specifically, show how the function would calculate the shortest path cost for each pair of cities (v, w) where v is a city and w is the distance between them. Justify your choice of approach considering efficiency. Topic: Graphs Subtopic: Graphs And Shortest Paths Marks: 5 Time: 20 Total Marks: 11
